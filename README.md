DCGAN for MNIST Handwritten Digit Generation
This project implements a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) using TensorFlow and Keras to generate images of handwritten digits similar to those in the MNIST dataset. The main components of the project are:

Project Overview
The project demonstrates the complete process of creating, training, and evaluating a DCGAN. The generator model learns to produce realistic images, while the discriminator model learns to distinguish between real and fake images. The two models are trained in tandem, each improving in response to the other.

Key Features
Data Preparation: The MNIST dataset is loaded, reshaped, and normalized to a range of [-1, 1].
Model Architecture:
Generator: Uses dense layers, batch normalization, and transposed convolutions to generate 28x28 pixel images from random noise.
Discriminator: A convolutional neural network (CNN) that classifies images as real or fake.
Loss Functions: Binary cross-entropy loss is used for both the generator and discriminator.
Optimizers: Adam optimizers with a learning rate of 0.0001 are employed for both models.
Training Loop: The models are trained for a specified number of epochs, with images generated and saved at each epoch to monitor progress.
Checkpointing: Models are saved at regular intervals to ensure that training can be resumed in case of interruptions.
Image Generation and Saving: Generated images are saved at each epoch, and an animated GIF is created to visualize the progression of the generator's performance.
